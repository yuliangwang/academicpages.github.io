Undergraduate students
======
* **Robert Burris**  
Computer Science + Applied Math. I am interested in Machine learning and data science applied to biology.   
* **Christina Chen**  
I am from Biochemistry and am interested in Medicine. I like the unlimited possibilities of stem cells in findings/treatments for diseases, and how this can be achieved through computational approaches.  
* **Santino Iannone**  
I am a senior in the microbiology department.
* **Jasmine Li**  
I major in Computer Science and expect to graduate in 2021. 
* **Lauren Liao**  
I am Ran(Lauren) Liao, majoring in Statistics: Data Science. I will graduate in 2022 and hopefully become a data scientist or get to my desired grad school. I involve in programming and data visualization mostly, hoping to bring meaningful answers to others by them. 
* **Masaki Rhodes**  
Biochemistry and Economics. I am interested in Oncology and human retroviruses, as well as how machine learning and data science are used in medicine.     
* **Vincent Joshua Soesanto**  
I am a Masters student in Computational Linguistics and I am interested in I’m interested in applying machine learning techniques to natural language processing problems (syntactic structures, topic models, predictive analysis).  
* **Irika Sinha**  
B.S. Biochemistry, B.S. Biology (MCD). I am interested in Neuroimmunology and the use of bioinformatics to understand changes at a cellular level.    
* **Dylan Stockard**   
I’m Dylan Stockard and I’m studying electrical engineering. I expect to graduate in 2022 and after college I plan on getting a masters degree in data science. My interests are in computational biology, wildlife conservation, and martial arts.
