I am a Research Assistant Professor at University of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. I also hold a joint appoint at the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM). 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Single cell RNA-seq in developmental processes and disease modeling
- Multi-omic data integration
- Metabolic network modeling
- Signaling network analysis

## Lab News:  
- Yuliang was selected to receive the 2020 Jaconette L. Tietze Young Scientist Award from the Institute for Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine at UW. 
- Spatially-resolved metabolic network modeling of prostate cancer tumor microenvironment was featured as a [publication of the week by Science in Seattle](https://scienceinseattle.com/2020/03/10/spatial-modeling-of-prostate-cancer-metabolic-gene-expression-reveals-extensive-heterogeneity-and-selective-vulnerabilities/).
