I am a Research Assistant Professor at University of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. I also hold a joint appoint at the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM). 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Single cell RNA-seq in developmental processes and disease modeling
- Multi-omic data integration
- Metabolic network modeling
- Signaling network analysis

## Lab News: 
- Signaling and transcriptional network analysis of podocyte aging was published at [Kidney International](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820307055).
- Yuliang was selected to receive the [2020 Jaconette L. Tietze Young Scientist Award from the Institute for Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine at UW](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2020/05/06/the-cell-whisperer-yuliang-wang-earns-young-scientist-award-for-advancing-computational-approaches-to-restore-intercellular-communication/). 
- Spatially-resolved metabolic network modeling of prostate cancer tumor microenvironment was featured as a [publication of the week by Science in Seattle](https://scienceinseattle.com/2020/03/10/spatial-modeling-of-prostate-cancer-metabolic-gene-expression-reveals-extensive-heterogeneity-and-selective-vulnerabilities/).
