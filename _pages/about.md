I am a Research Assistant Professor at University of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. I also hold a joint appoint at the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM). 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Single cell RNA-seq in developmental processes and disease modeling
- Multi-omic data integration
- Metabolic network modeling
- Signaling network analysis

## Lab News: 
- 01-19-2021: A new preprint from our lab describing a novel computational method called perturb-Met (perturbed metabolites) that can discover metabolic network chagnes in diseases and developmental processes using single cell RNA-seq data. perturb-Met [Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427154v1). Github link for the perturb-met [R package](https://github.com/yuliangwang/perturb.met). Tutorial available at [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/wang341/perturb-met).  
- 11-20-2020: Our lab was awarded a pilot grant from the [Unversity of Washington Center for Translational Muscle Research](https://iscrm.uw.edu/stories/new-muscle-center-for-uw-medicine/). The aim of our project is to identify metabolic interventions to mature iPSC-derived skeletal muscle cells by network-based multi-omic data integration. Many thanks to collaborators at the [Mack lab](http://www.rehab.washington.edu/education/faculty/nonproviderbios/mack.asp) and [Ruohola-Baker lab](http://depts.washington.edu/taneli/). 
- 10-27-2020: Signaling and transcriptional network analysis of podocyte aging was published at [Kidney International](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820307055), with [Commentary](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0085253820309558). 
- 10-09-2020: Santino Iannone from our lab received the Levinson Emerging Scholar Award. Congratulations, Santino!
- 05-06-2020: Yuliang was selected to receive the [2020 Jaconette L. Tietze Young Scientist Award from the Institute for Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine at UW](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2020/05/06/the-cell-whisperer-yuliang-wang-earns-young-scientist-award-for-advancing-computational-approaches-to-restore-intercellular-communication/). 
- Spatially-resolved metabolic network modeling of prostate cancer tumor microenvironment was featured as a [publication of the week by Science in Seattle](https://scienceinseattle.com/2020/03/10/spatial-modeling-of-prostate-cancer-metabolic-gene-expression-reveals-extensive-heterogeneity-and-selective-vulnerabilities/). 
- The [metabolic analysis of embryonic diapause](https://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/fulltext/S1534-5807(19)31067-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1534580719310676%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) was [highlighted by Developmental Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580720300022).
- The single cell RNA-seq analysis of "disease in a dish" model of sudden infant death syndrome was published in Nature Communications and [highlighted by UW Medicine News](https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/new-genetic-link-found-some-forms-sids). 
- Our discovery of significant sex-specific transcriptomic changes in the aging process of a type of kidney progenitor cells, cells of the renin lineage (CoRL) was [featured as the Cover of the Aging journal](https://www.aging-us.com/issue/v10i4).
