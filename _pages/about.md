I am a Research Assistant Professor at University of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. I also hold a joint appoint at the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM). 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Single cell RNA-seq in developmental processes and disease modeling
- Multi-omic data integration
- Metabolic network modeling
- Signaling network analysis

## Lab News:  
- Yuliang was selected to receive the 2020 Jaconette L. Tietze Young Scientist Award from the Institute for Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine at UW. 
- Spatially-resolved metabolic network modeling of prostate cancer tumor microenvironment was featured as a [publication of the week by Science in Seattle](https://scienceinseattle.com/2020/03/10/spatial-modeling-of-prostate-cancer-metabolic-gene-expression-reveals-extensive-heterogeneity-and-selective-vulnerabilities/). 
- The [metabolic analysis of embryonic diapause](https://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/fulltext/S1534-5807(19)31067-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1534580719310676%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) was [highlighted by Developmental Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580720300022).
