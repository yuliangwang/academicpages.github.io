I am a Staff Data Scientist at Verily Life Sciences (formerly Google[x] Life Sciences). I was a Research Assistant Professor at University of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering for 6 years (2016-2021), where I also held a joint appoint at the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM). My lab developed novel computational methods and analytic workflows to mine massive heterogeneous biomedical datasets and address complex problems in stem cell development, kidney diseases, aging, and cancer. 

## Research Interests and Projects:

- Single cell RNA-seq in developmental processes and disease modeling
- Multi-omic data integration
- Metabolic network modeling
- Signaling network analysis

## Lab News: 
- 03-31-2021: The [spatially-resolved metabolic network model of prostate cancer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60384-w) is ranked as the [Top 100 in Cancer](https://www.nature.com/collections/aijhgffdjh) out of over 1000 cancer papers published by Scientific Reports. 
- 02-15-2021: Yuliang was awarded a pilot grant from the University of Washington Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (one of 30 nation wide resource centers funded by the National Institute of Aging). This grant supports the development of novel machine learning methods to identify metabolic changes that enable the generation of more mature microglia from patient-derived pluripotent stem cells. 
- 01-19-2021: A new preprint from our lab describing a novel computational method called perturb-Met (perturbed metabolites) that can discover metabolic network chagnes in diseases and developmental processes using single cell RNA-seq data. perturb-Met [Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427154v1). Github link for the perturb-met [R package](https://github.com/yuliangwang/perturb.met). Tutorial available at [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/wang341/perturb-met).  
- 11-20-2020: Our lab was awarded a pilot grant from the [Unversity of Washington Center for Translational Muscle Research](https://iscrm.uw.edu/stories/new-muscle-center-for-uw-medicine/). The aim of our project is to identify metabolic interventions to mature iPSC-derived skeletal muscle cells by network-based multi-omic data integration. Many thanks to collaborators at the [Mack lab](http://www.rehab.washington.edu/education/faculty/nonproviderbios/mack.asp) and [Ruohola-Baker lab](http://depts.washington.edu/taneli/). 
- 10-27-2020: Signaling and transcriptional network analysis of podocyte aging was published at [Kidney International](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820307055), with [Commentary](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0085253820309558). 
- 10-09-2020: Santino Iannone from our lab received the Levinson Emerging Scholar Award. Congratulations, Santino!
- 05-06-2020: Yuliang was selected to receive the [2020 Jaconette L. Tietze Young Scientist Award from the Institute for Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine at UW](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2020/05/06/the-cell-whisperer-yuliang-wang-earns-young-scientist-award-for-advancing-computational-approaches-to-restore-intercellular-communication/). 
- Spatially-resolved metabolic network modeling of prostate cancer tumor microenvironment was featured as a [publication of the week by Science in Seattle](https://scienceinseattle.com/2020/03/10/spatial-modeling-of-prostate-cancer-metabolic-gene-expression-reveals-extensive-heterogeneity-and-selective-vulnerabilities/). 
- The [metabolic analysis of embryonic diapause](https://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/fulltext/S1534-5807(19)31067-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1534580719310676%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) was [highlighted by Developmental Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580720300022).
- The single cell RNA-seq analysis of "disease in a dish" model of sudden infant death syndrome was published in Nature Communications and [highlighted by UW Medicine News](https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/new-genetic-link-found-some-forms-sids). 
- Our discovery of significant sex-specific transcriptomic changes in the aging process of a type of kidney progenitor cells, cells of the renin lineage (CoRL) was [featured as the Cover of the Aging journal](https://www.aging-us.com/issue/v10i4).
