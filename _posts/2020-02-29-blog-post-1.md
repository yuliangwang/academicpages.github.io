This is an outline of a series of blogs that I plan to write in 2020 that will share many tools and code snippets that I find useful in Bioinformatics. 

## RNA-seq
  * Alignment (hisat2)
  * Get read counts (feature counts)
  * Differential expression (DESeq), volcano plot, heatmaps
  * PCA plot, including scatter plot of how genes contribute to PC1 and PC2
  * Batch effect correction
  * Projecting other people's datasets onto your dataset (or vice versa) using PCA
  * Pathway enrichment

## ChIP-seq
  * Call peaks
  * Peak set enrichment using [GREAT](http://great.stanford.edu/public/html/)
  * Annotate peaks to genes using [ChIPpeakAnno](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChIPpeakAnno.html)
  * Differential peaks using diffReps
  * Visualization using ngs.plot
  * Integration with RNA-seq data
  
## Metabolic network analysis
  * mCADRE
  * Metabolic pathway enrichment 
  * Visualize transcriptomics and metabolomics data together in KEGG pathway maps

## Data wrangling in R

## Data visualization in R
